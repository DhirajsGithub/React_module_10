React-context is not optimized for
high-frequency state changes

## Why reudx toolkit : 
Redux Toolkit makes it easier to write good Redux applications and speeds up development, by baking in our recommended best practices, providing good default behaviors, catching mistakes, and allowing you to write simpler code.
